       <ol>
           <li>My name is Hallie King. My major is Communication Design and this is my third year at WashU.</li>
           <li>I am taking this class because I am pursuing the Human-Computer Interaction minor and I am interested in including UI and UX in my design practice.</li>
           <li>Last fall I took Web Development, so I have some introductory experience with HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
           <li>In this class, I hope to get a better sense of formatting in HTML and CSS so that I can can collaborate more effectively on future projects.</li>
           <li>One way that I expect designing for screen to be different than designing for print is the intended viewing distance. Because we view laptop screens, mobile devices, and printed documents from different distances, I expect there will be some adjustments in elements like type size.</li>
           <li>I think the <a href="https://silotheatre.co.nz/">Silo Theatre</a> website has a very bold and engaging design system. It utilizes large typography very effectively and includes simple animations for a more dynamic experience.</li>
           <li>The <a href="https://curative.com/">Curative</a> website takes a very clear approach to communication. As a website geared towards healthcare, it is important that its users can easily access the resources they need. To accomplish this, the website has very clear calls to action accompanied by helpful and compelling visuals.</li>
           <li>I think <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/">It's Nice That</a> is a website that works really well. The homepage accomodates several different article headlines, but maintains a hierarchy that doesn't overwhelm the user.</li>
